# blockchain_farmer
This repository is for developing a blockchain based mechanism in which farmers get a proportional share of prices at which their produce is being sold at further stages of the supply chain.
For simplicity I have taken a case where there is one farmer who produces paddy and the supply chain has five levels.
FARMER-------RICE MILL------PACKAGER-----RETAILER-----CONSUMER.
Assume farmer has produced Q quantity of grain and has sold it to RICE MILL at price PF per unit of quntity.
Again The RICE MILL sells the processed Rice to PACKAGER at price PM per unit of quntity.
The PACKAGER sells the packaged Rice to RETAILER at price PP per unit of quntity.
The Reatailer sells the final good at price PR per unit of quntity.
The proportion that farmer should get out of each price is x.
farmers income at the completion on supply chain is Q {PF + x (PM + PP + PR)}
